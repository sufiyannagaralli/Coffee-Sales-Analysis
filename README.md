# Coffee-Sales-Analysis/ Presentation https://youtu.be/wIT65Xx3MgA?feature=shared
The main goal of this project was to create KPIs and maps based on timelines and columns to gain clear insights, helping us make more informed decisions. We also used MSSQL to cross-check the data for accuracy and consistency throughout the analysis.
Here's the key questions I was interested in answering?
What is the total sales analysis?
How does total order analysis contribute to understanding customer behaviour?
What insights can be gained from analyzing the total quantity sold?
Does sales performance differ between weekdays and weekends?
How does total sales vary across different locations?
Which are the top 10 product types by sales?**

Approach Used
Imported data into Power Query for analysis.
Created a date table and linked it with other tables.
Developed DAX functions to use throughout the project.
Created KPIs and charts on the cleaned data to uncover valuable insights.
Uploaded the project to Power BI Service and scheduled automatic data refreshes.
